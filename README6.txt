CPU:
	ALU (Arithmetic logic unit)
	Control unit
	Clock
	Registers

The way CPU xomunicate with I/O and Memory:
	Control bus: keep operation syncronize between divices conected to the bus / multiple operation on same time (I guess)
	Address bus: store the address of data changed between CPU and divices
	Data bus   : handle the transfer of data between cpu and memory and I/O devices

Arithmetic logic unit: do operations like AND, OR, NOT
Memory register: memory of CPU (fastest one to access)
Clock: heart beating of CPU / 1GHz = 1 billion times per second
Control Unit: decode instruction direct operations to other units (memory/ ALU, I/O)
